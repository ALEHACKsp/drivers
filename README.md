Some Windows drivers I have developed

## List of Drivers
1. [ProcMon](https://github.com/omerk2511/drivers/tree/master/ProcMon) - A driver that allows the user to configure executable paths that should not be allowed to execute. Actually exercise 1 of chapter 8 in Pavel Yosifovich's great book [Windows Kernel Programming](https://leanpub.com/windowskernelprogramming).
2. [RemoteThreadDetector](https://github.com/omerk2511/drivers/tree/master/RemoteThreadDetector) - A driver that detects remote thread creations (threads that are created in processes other than their own). Typically used to detect classic code injection techniques. Actually exercise 2 of chapter 8 in Pavel Yosifovich's great book [Windows Kernel Programming](https://leanpub.com/windowskernelprogramming).
